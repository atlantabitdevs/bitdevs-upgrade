Itâ€™s almost time for [Bitcoin Socratic Seminar
#8](https://www.meetup.com/atlantabitdevs/events/286248874/)!

## What is a Socratic Seminar?

Inspired by other BitDevs meetups around the US, our Socratic Seminar events
are formatted to foster debate, information sharing and lively discussion.

  1. Discussion topics are provided ahead of the event
  2. The event moderator(s) leads the audience through the topics
  3. Raise your hand to grab the mic and participate in the conversation
  4. We go to a bar afterwards

## Opening Presentation

Everyday, our privacy and control over personal data is slipping away. What
can you do about it? Jordan Bravo will kick off the evening by sharing what
he's learned from his own journey to reclaim digital sovereignty: this
includes things like encryption, privacy tools, self-hosted email, being your
own cloud, and of course, bitcoin.

EDIT: Here's [Jordan's presentation deck](content/uploads/2022/06/Seminar-
Digital-Self-Sovereignty-and-Privacy-2022-06-29.pptx) if you need a reminder
about some of the tools he discussed.

## Discussion Topics

Next, we'll go over the latest in bitcoin and lightning development.
