Itâ€™s almost time for [Bitcoin Socratic Seminar
#12](https://www.meetup.com/atlantabitdevs/events/287231385/)!

## What is a Socratic Seminar?

Inspired by other BitDevs meetups around the US, our Socratic Seminar events
are formatted to foster debate, information sharing and lively discussion.

  1. Discussion topics are provided ahead of the event
  2. The event moderator(s) leads the audience through the topics
  3. Raise your hand to grab the mic and participate in the conversation
  4. We go to a bar afterwards

We'll start out talking about the [Summer of
Bitcoin](https://www.summerofbitcoin.org/), which is a global internship
program focused on introducing university students to open-source bitcoin
projects. We'll be joined by Autumn Domingo and Pedro Felix, who recently were
students in this program.
