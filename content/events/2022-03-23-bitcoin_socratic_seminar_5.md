It's time for the [first Atlanta BitDevs Socratic Seminar of
2022](https://www.meetup.com/atlantabitdevs/events/283224005/)! Come hang out
with Bitcoiners and developers to discuss the latest developments in Bitcoin,
Lightning, and related technology.

## What is a Socratic Seminar?

Inspired by other BitDevs meetups around the US, our Socratic Seminar events
are formatted to foster debate, information sharing and lively discussion.

  1. Discussion topics are provided ahead of the event
  2. The event moderator(s) leads the audience through the topics
  3. Raise your hand to grab the mic and participate in the conversation
  4. We go to a bar afterwards

This past weekend, members of Atlanta BitDevs participated in the SatsX
hackathon and took the Overall Best Prize for **PlebFM** , an auction-style
jukebox where you big over the Lightning network to bump your music to the top
of the queue. [Alex Lewin of NCR](https://twitter.com/Cork__Screw) will do a
presentation on this project, his motivations for the idea, and what he
learned from building it.

### Spads üéÜ

"Spontaneous Ads" are opt-in ads. Advertisers pay over Lightning to post the
ad, and users are paid over Lightning in order to have the ads delivered to
them. It's sort of a cut-out-the-middle-man model.
