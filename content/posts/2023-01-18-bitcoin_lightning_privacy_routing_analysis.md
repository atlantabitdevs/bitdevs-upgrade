# Bitcoin Lightning Privacy: Routing Analysis

![](content/uploads/2023/01/ATLBitDevs_2023-01-18_lightning-

We're [meeting
tonight](https://www.meetup.com/atlantabitdevs/events/290912698/) to discuss
the [Routing Analysis](https://lightningprivacy.com/en/routing-analysis)
chapter of [Lightning Privacy
Research](https://lightningprivacy.com/en/introduction). Here are some notes
to help prepare you for the discussion!

NOTE: This is just Stephen sharing his notes with you and not actually a well
thought-out or spellchecked instructional plan. üôÉ

## Lightning Privacy Introduction

{'<'}https://lightningprivacy.com/en/introduction{'>'}

  * Bitcoin Layer 1 - all TXes visible on a public blockchain
  * Lightning (Layer 2) - No central ledger, peer-to-peer

### Problems

  * When a LN payment is associated with a BTC TX
  * P2P LN nodes know certain payment details
  * Highly connected LN nodes see a larger percent of network

### ‚ùì Questions

What is an anonymity set?

## Routing Analysis

{'<'}https://lightningprivacy.com/en/routing-analysis{'>'}

  * LN uses onion routing for a certain amount of source and destination privacy

### ‚ùì Questions

How is LN onion routing similar to TOR? How is it different?

  * Problem statement - there‚Äôs situations where the sender and receiver can be learned by routing nodes
    * Some scenarios allow routers to infer this info
    * A single actor controlling multiple nodes can correlate payment info

### ‚ùì Questions

What is an LSP? How might using an LSP affect privacy?

  * HTLCs - using the same payment hash each time can affect privacy
  * Wormhole attack - allows dishonest users to steal routing fees from honest users along a payment path - outlined in this paper: [](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/472.pdf){'<'}https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/472.pdf{'>'}
    * Basically, 2 malicious nodes (Mike and Mallory) are on the same payment route and collaborate
    * Normal behavior: nodes pass the preimage back to the prior node to unwind HTLCs
    * Evil behavior: Mike passes preimage back to Mallory, skipping all the nodes in between, and M & M take the routing fees of every node that was skipped
  * PTLCs might fix this
    * PTLCs explained on SuredBits - [](https://suredbits.com/payment-points-part-1/#references){'<'}https://suredbits.com/payment-points-part-1/#references{'>'}
  * Timing delays - basically, estimating how far away source of destination of a payment is by how long it takes to settle
    * Top nodes can perform timing analysis on the majority of payments [](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12143.pdf){'<'}https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12143.pdf{'>'}
    * What if you run multiple nodes, and you route a payment for amount X, and then milliseconds later your other nodes routes a payment for slightly less than amount X.
    * What if average payment time between your node and neighbor is 100ms? If you route a payment to tyour neighbor and the HTLC or PTLC is fulfilled in about 100ms, you can assume your neighbor was the final hop.

### ‚ùì Questions

Should nodes add a random delay to fix timing analysis? It must be 2-3x delay
to be meaningful, but does this affect usability of the LN? (See Peter Todd‚Äôs
comment on [opting into slower payments for the sake of
privacy](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-
dev/2022-June/003621.html))

  * Random delay could be neat, but isn‚Äôt enforceable
  * MPP - Multipath payments
  * Randomize them to improve them
  * Multipath improves privacy
  * Randomizing the multipath and multiple shards to each node improves further
  * Splinter payments - MPP initiates midway through route
  * Splinter is theoretical atm
    * Protocol change needed?
    * Can splintering be enforced?
  * Longer paths?
    * 6 degress of sep
    * Go beyond 9 hops
  * Analyzing multipath payments
    * Less info can be gleaned (dont know full payment amount)
    * Anonymity set increases if more folks use MPP
      * Thought to self: reminds of CoinJoins in a way. Could people route MPPs with preset denominations to improve privacy?

### ‚ùì Questions

  * What are positives for implementing the author‚Äôs suggestions?
  * What are negatives for these suggestions?
  * Implementation notes
    * PTLCs - no progress has been made since taproot softfork
    * Timing delays - no active work being done to the knowledge of the authors
    * MPP is possible today. Splintering has not been discussed before.
