# Diving into tbDEX

![](content/uploads/2022/02/ATLBitDevs_2022-02-15_tbDEX-1-1568x882.png)

Last year, a division of Block (formerly Square) known as
[TBD54566975](https://twitter.com/tbd54566975) released a whitepaper for a
protocol called _tbDEX_. The goal seems to be to create a decentralized way of
exchanging fiat for bitcoin, and vice-versa.

They launched the whitepaper in a blog post. For our next reading session,
let's discuss their [blog post](https://tbd54566975.ghost.io/introducing-
tbdex/). This should be a nice, easy way to get into this topic before
tackling the whitepaper. We'll tackle the whitepaper itself in a future
session.
