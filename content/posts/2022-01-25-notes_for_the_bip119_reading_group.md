We're looking forward to[ seeing everyone next week for the BIP-119 reading
group](https://www.meetup.com/atlantabitdevs/events/283206504/). Here are some
notes and resources to help you out.

## What are we reading?

ðŸ“™ [BIP-119 by Jeremy
Rubin](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0119.mediawiki)

{'>'} This BIP proposes a new opcode, OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY, to be activated as a
{'>'} change to the semantics of OP_NOP4.  
{'>'}  
{'>'} The new opcode has applications for transaction congestion control and
{'>'} payment channel instantiation, among others, which are described in the
{'>'} Motivation section of this BIP.
{'>'}
{'>'} [From
{'>'} BIP-119](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0119.mediawiki)

## How else can I follow along?

If you are new to studying Bitcoin, find the document too difficult, or simply
want some other contextual information, try these other sources instead. They
will help you to follow along with the discussion.

ðŸŽ™ [Jeremy Rubin on Stephan Livera's
podcast](https://stephanlivera.com/episode/339/) - this entire episode is
dedicated to Check Template Verify (BIP-119).

ðŸ’» [UTXOs.org](https://utxos.org/) - this is an informational website Jeremy
put together which outlines the vision for BIP-119 and lays out examples for
how it would be used.

## Questions to Consider

See if you can find the answers to the questions. Some of the questions are
targeted at beginners, while others are more advanced. Some answers you will
find in the reading material, some you may have to conduct your own research
for, and some require you to do some thinking and form your own opinion.

  * What is a BIP?
  * Why do Bitcoin developers use BIPs? What would it look like if there were no BIPs?
  * What is a covenant? Should Bitcoin have covenants?
  * Do you think that "templates" are a good way to implement covenants in Bitcoin?
  * What are some of the use-cases for templates?
  * What are potential risks associated with this BIP?
  * What is a soft-fork?
  * What's an argument for supporting this BIP?
  * What's an argument for opposing this BIP?
