# Cypherpunk Manifesto

Last night we had a nice break from discussing the latest in bitcoin and
lightning. Instead, we discussed the cypherpunk manifesto, an important piece
of writing from the cypherpunk movement. The cypherpunk movement arguably led
to the creation of bitcoin, among other technologies.

Here are some links to things we discussed during the session:
